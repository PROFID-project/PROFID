## Study 3 variable mapping files

This folder contains variable mapping tables (“small map” and “master map”)
used to harmonise dataset-specific variables to common Study 3 variables.

The files include variable names only and do not contain patient-level data.
They are intended for internal PROFID collaborators with approved data access.
